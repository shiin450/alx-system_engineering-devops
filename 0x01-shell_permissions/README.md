10-mirror_permissions:  Sets the mode of the file same as another file's mode using * chmod --reference=sourceFile1 targetfile*
11-directories_permissions: Adds execute permission to all subdirectories of the current directory for all users, not affecting regular files. using *find ./ -type d -exec chmod ugo+x {} +*, this commind finds all directory in current directory *find ./ -type d * then the *-exec chmod ugo+x {}+* applies chmod command for every directory, the *{}+* runs the chmod commad on every directory by appending each selected directory name at the end, this will reduce number invocations of the command.

103-Star_Wars :plays the StarWars IV episode in the terminal. I was almost ðŸ˜ž  the task didn't provide much informatin, how to play, it a game or movies after sometime of googling, I found using *telnet" that you can watch StarWars on your terminal.

## What have I learned through these tasks

1. To be effective: since I was supposed to create around 17 files, add each one of #!/bin/bash ,change mod all of the files to u+x, add them to git and push: it was so much work, so I came with plan a. create,change mod and put #!/bin/bash files in batches. using 
I. touch file1 file2 file3....,
II. chmod u+x file1 file2 file3..,
II. echo \#\!/bin/bash | tee  file1 file2 file3..

2. It is very important to read man pages for the commands you are running if you are not sure about anything.
3. Why have I written all of this, just to reflect what I have done and gonethrough and it is a requirement in the project.
